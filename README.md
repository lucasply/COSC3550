# COSC3550
Repository holding our submission for our final project for COSC3550. For our game we used unity version 2022.3.56f1. 

Something to note: Unity and Github are tempermental (metadata hell), don't merge your work if someone is working off of the main and their work takes longer than yours. Just note on how you can redo what
you've done and accept that you'll have to redo it. 

Steps to get the game on your unity hub:
1: Clone the directory on your github desktop, https://github.com/lucasply/COSC3550.git
2: Make your branch, give it a cool useful name
3: Move to unity hub and click 'add', select from disk, then navigate to your github directory and find this repo and select the 'Kong Donkey' folder
4: Launch the project and verify everything installed correctly
5: Fin
PS: Make sure you launch the scene you want to work on before making any edits, launching the game from the github repo doesn't automatically put you in a scene, this makes it look like there is nothing on the game.
